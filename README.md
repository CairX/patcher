## Tests
The root directory of a test should indicate the purpose of the test.

**Format**
```
operation/type/location/naming
```
* operation - An action (`++`, `--`, or `>>`) can sometime perform multiple types of operation. For example the `++` can both add a new file or update an existing one. To be specific about what the test is supposed to evaluate we use the operation name rather than the action name.
* type - File or directory.
* location - The level of directory nesting that is being tested.
    * Root, direct child of the version folder.
    * Sub, placed within a second level of directory.
* naming - The type of naming pattern that is being tested.
	* Standard, an alphabetical word in lower case.
	* Spaces, a lower case name containing at least one white space.
